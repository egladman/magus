### Added

- Playground: an in-browser CodeMirror editor with live diagnostics, module and
  symbol autocompletion, hover docs, and call-signature help, backed by the
  WebAssembly interpreter; a collapsible notice lists the host modules the
  browser cannot run.
- Docs site: first-class `/blog` subsystem with reverse-chronological listing,
  breadcrumb root, per-post edit links, and Blog nav item.
- Docs site: two Atom 1.0 feeds — `/public/atom/blog.atom.xml` (posts) and
  `/public/atom/releases.atom.xml` (releases, derived from this file).
- Docs site: nested Apache-`mod_autoindex`-styled `/public/` tree with an
  autoindex helper — hub at `/public/`, feeds at `/public/atom/`, release
  artifacts at `/public/release/`.

### Changed

- Docs site: extensionless URLs everywhere (`/documentation/`, `/modules/fs/`);
  the authored `docs/manpage/gen/` path segment is flattened out of public URLs.
- Docs site: nine flat client scripts collapsed into a two-file esbuild bundle
  (`theme.js` head-critical, `main.js` deferred module).
- Docs site: nav link "GitHub" moved to the footer, relabeled "Source Code".

### Fixed

- Docs site: mobile TOC becomes a slide-up bottom-sheet instead of stacking
  above the article; page toolbar reflows so search fills its row and
  "Suggest an edit" drops below.
