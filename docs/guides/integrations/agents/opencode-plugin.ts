// magus guard hook for OpenCode. OpenCode has no shell-command hook config: a
// plugin intercepts tool calls instead, and throwing from tool.execute.before
// blocks the call.
//
// This file is the source of truth. Copy it to ~/.config/opencode/plugins/ (or
// .opencode/plugins/) and adjust to taste; nothing in it is magus-internal.
//
// It encodes no magus rule. Every decision comes from `magus hook`, so
// this stays host-only glue rather than a second rule set that drifts out of
// step with the other hosts' templates.
//
// Covers BOTH guard surfaces, so OpenCode gets the same rules Claude Code does:
//   bash          the command rules (deny; advise surfaced to the human)
//   edit | write  the declared-output rule (deny only)
//
// PATH contract: this shells out to `magus` by name, inheriting PATH from the
// opencode process. If magus lives in a prefix PATH does not include (mise,
// brew, asdf, ~/.local/bin), set GUARD_MAGUS_BIN to an absolute path. That name
// deliberately avoids the MAGUS_* space, which is magus's own config surface.
